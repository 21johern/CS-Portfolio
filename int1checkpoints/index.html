        <p class="imageparagraph"> I am Joseph Hernandez, a 14 year boy. I spend my life at my school, Summit Shasta. I spend all of my free time on homework, the chaos I call a friend group, Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, and reading. I love to cook, build things,
            eat food, swim, and make brash jokes with my friends. I have reasoning behind many of my habits. I love to make things like food, because I can't stand the felling of accomplishing nothing. I don't know why I like swimming. Honestly, I don't
            think while I'm in the water. I just swim mindlessly, enjoying the peace it provides me. Generally, after two hours of hard swimming, I'm incredibly hungry, meaning I have to cook, to accomplish my goal of getting less hungry. Do I really
            need to explain brash jokes? As a human male, it is my responsibility to make immature jokes. Otherwise, I spend my time doing Magic the Gathering, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons. I like these activities for a few reasons. One thig
            I love is the freedom to do anything, and Magic and D&D provide me the most freedom you can get. I love the ability to anything ranging from fight a dragon to simply make jokes in a tavern that D&D gives me, as well as the opportunity to improvise
            and make the jankiest of all Magic decks. Because of these interests, my weeks look something like this: </p>
