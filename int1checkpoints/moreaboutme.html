    <h1>A Short Story About Me</h1>
    <div class="aboutme">
        <h2>The Life of an Ex-Criminal</h2>
        <p>Odd as it may seem, it wasn’t my parents, some celebrity, or my brother who made me the strange person I am today. I’d like to blame my troubles on my friends, Archer Prochazka, who has changed everything about me, ranging from what I read to
            what I spend my free time doing; Travis Hamilton, who has given me my oddity; and lastly Joshua Tanner, who brought us all together. When I first met them in 3rd grade, we were all just tiny nerds wandering around who had almost nothing in
            common except the fact that we played Pokemon together. Today, I think the only thing we don’t have in common is blood. We have grown up together and changed each other’s habits and personalities.</p>
        <p>Let’s slow down for a second. Who am I? Who is talking to you about their life without even introducing themselves? I am Joseph Hernandez, not quite infamous, but a criminal of sorts. I have stolen from those who I love, seen the worst of times
            alone, seen the best of times with the best of friends, and made the worst of regrets with the worst kind of people.</p>
        I mentioned that I am a criminal of sorts, but that is solely in behavior, not mindset. Taking off your coat is a perfect example of behavior based on instinct. You don’t think I’m too hot. You just know it and take off your coat. I know better than most
        that basing behavior on reason is the safest way to live, for sometimes instinct can go directly against other’s desires.
        <p>I believe that joy is a necessity, and when you lack it you, simply do things to find it. When I first found myself in a place without joy, I tried video games. Unfortunately, being ten, I wasn’t quite the best at them and easily became frustrated.
            I tried everything. I tried looking up strategies, I tried simply practicing, but I was no good.</p>
        <p>One day, I asked my dad if I could have a little money for the game, attempting to pay to win. Unfortunately, his credit card number stuck on my device. Nonchalantly, I used it, simply thinking, What harm could it do? The answer is a lot. Bit
            by bit, I continued to absentmindedly use his credit card without considering the actual implications of what I was doing. Oh, the innocence that was lost. Young children have the awe-inspiring ability to simply not think, a task Buddhists
            have been aspiring to accomplish for centuries.</p>
        <p>About a month later, my dad got his credit card bill in the mail. He was simply shocked. I was his good son, not the one who had been expelled from high school for drug dealing.</p>
        <p>It took him a grand total of about five minutes to simply ask, “Joe, did you use my credit card?” This started a disconnect between the two of us that would take years to repair.</p>
        <p>I had become truly alone. I didn’t have my parents to guide me through everything anymore. Though I didn’t know it at the time , this is when I would find myself. Before I was restrained, yet given all of the support I needed to thrive; now I
            was free, but I only had the most basic of support. In order to stay sane, I would need someone else to support me, not just my parents. I assumed that I couldn’t always trust my current friends: they were too goofy.</p>
        <p>Eric was an animal loving boy and he would spend hours on end exploring his forest of a backyard. I had talked to him quite a bit in class and decided that I would try to spend some time with him. Unfortunately, many good things come with drawbacks;
            the drawback of spending time with Eric meant that sometimes I had to deal with a bully, Jaden.</p>
        <p>Jaden was a tall guy as far as fifth graders go, standing at about 5’2”. He was, simply put, a troubled boy. He was the kind of person who threw rotten fruit at people while maniacally laughing. He was my tormentor, the sole person I avoided at
            all costs.</p>
        <p>Thinking that I could ignore Jaden, I refused to give up Eric’s friendship. When Eric and I spent time together, I usually would ignore Jaden or walk away at the first glance of him. Of course, there were times when this didn’t work.</p>
        <p>At times, I would find myself doing something inexplicably stupid with Eric, when Jaden would worm his way onto what we were doing and ruin the experience. For example, one day, when Eric and I were testing who could piggyback the other further,
            when Jaden joined the fun. It was Eric’s turn to try to carry me when Jaden decided that it as an appropriate time to throw rocks at me. When he threw rocks at me, the most basic sign of contempt, I got the message: stay away from my friends.</p>
        </p>Despite this interference, Eric and I enjoyed ourselves. We climbed, we ran, and we joked. After about six months we were the best of friends. We spent time climbing trees, storage containers, and almost anything else we could jump off of.</p>
        <p>One day, after I had to deal with Jaden, Eric admitted, “Honestly I can’t deal with him anymore. He’s an idiot who takes out his rage on others.”</p>
        <p>Surprised, I asked, “Why do you spend time with him?”</p>
        <p>He replied, “Our families are close friends, and they want us to spend time together, but I can’t stand him. He ruins all of my friendships, he follows me everywhere, and he’ll do anything to torment people he doesn’t like.” This caught me off
            guard, but I wasn’t completely surprised to learn that I wasn’t his only victim.</p>
        <p>About a week later, when I was reading at home, my mom called me to her desk.</p>
        <p>I asked, “What is it?”</p>
        <p>“You’ve been invited to your friend Eric’s birthday party,” she explained.</p>
        <p>After that, I stumbled through the weeks, waiting for the party.</p>
        <p>Finally, about two weeks later, it was time for Eric’s birthday party. I hadn’t bothered to check who else was going to his party, so I was especially surprised to see Jaden there. I tried to simply ignore his presence, but it was genuinely hard.
            When there is a grand total of three people in a party, it is incredibly hard to ignore one person.</p>
        <p>Every once and awhile, he would something that really got to me, like cheat in our video games, or piss off a group of high schoolers at the park and get us all chased. Though these actions were annoying, they were excusable(less so for the second
            one), and life went on.</p>
        <p>Yet, we also had perfect moments, ones where nothing went wrong at all. We put water balloons in a slingshot, then shot them into the stormy skies, we rode down a nearly vertical hill on bikes, and we explored Eric’s gigantic backyard, chasing
            his chickens across the yard, along with all of the other wildlife in it.</p>
        <p>Life is a roller coaster, one where everything you do for several years builds up to one big thing, usually a drop or a loop. Life isn’t predictable, and to simply ignore your luck is risky. When I found myself in this great of a situation with
            Jaden around, I grew suspicious. I found myself on a slow incline, and when I looked down, I couldn’t even see the ground. I knew the sudden drop was coming. I didn’t care though. I just rode on. I was having the time of my life. What a mistake.</p>
        <p>As we returned inside dripping wet, done sending water balloons into the stormy skies, and we got ready for bed. I found myself thirsty, after all, seeing water fall from the sky has a tendency to do that to me. I poured myself a cup of water,
            drank a bit and went off to brush my teeth. Sleepily, I wondered, How come have no tricks been pulled on me yet? As quickly as the thought wandered its way into my head, it slipped right out. I walked out of the bathroom and took a sip of
            my water, only to find the foulest taste I have ever fill my mouth instead of the harmless water I expected. It tasted like sour milk mixed with poi.</p>
        <p>I spat it out immediately and roared, “What the hell even is this! Who messed with my water!”</p>
        <p>Laughing. All that I hear in response is cruel laughing. It’s Jaden.</p>
        <p>I’d like to say that right about then, reason went out the door. I’d like to say that I punched him right in the gut. If I did it, I probably wouldn’t regret it. So why didn’t I punch him? As I said, I like to think of myself as a man of reason.
            I have brief breaks in character, but I try not to let emotion guide me. I could have punched him right in the gut, but to what avail? Would it really improve my life? The honest answer is no. The risk was far greater than the reward, and
            I weighed my options.</p>
        <p>After I calmed down, I simply asked, “Why?”</p>
        </p>Eric said, “He told me to,” and pointed to Jaden. Eric did it. My new best friend had relieved himself in my water and used the dark to trick me into drinking it. I gave up then and there.</p>
        <p>After hearing me yell, Eric’s mom had rushed down the stairs, into the room living room where we were supposed to sleep. I explained myself, not caring what they thought, and she immediately called my mom. I had to stay the night as planned, but
            she would pick me up at about seven, two hours earlier than planned.</p>
        <p>Don’t pity me. I don’t weep over my life or wish for a re-do. I know who I am. I am a criminal who stole $3,000 from his own father. I am a man of reason who has done things without a thought in his head. I have made the worst regrets with the
            worst sort of people. Most importantly, I know the value of true friendship. </p>
        <p>My friends don’t pee in my water. When I went back to my friends Archer, Travis, and Josh, they supported me. My friends are an extension of who I am, and I am an extension of them. My friends are my family. A family has the job of supporting
            you. My friends have supported me a lot better than my pothead brother. Your family shapes who you are. My friends have shaped what I do in my free time, how I get by in school, and even how I behave. Your family gives you food and shelter.
            My friends would do that for me, I daresay.</p>
        <p>I love my family, but I don’t simply love my family because. I love my family despite. This is a lesson taught to me by my friends through a book they showed me. “Anyone can love a thing because. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket.</p>
        <p>But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.(The Wise Man’s Fear, Rothfuss, p. 56)” My friends are human beings, and they have flaws. Travis lacks manners at times, Archer is too blunt,
            and Josh is just too forgiving. Today I have a true bond with my family, and we are there to be supporting in the way that socially awkward people do. My friends have made me who I am. Many people are a product of their environment; I would
            argue that I am a product of my peers and the experiences they have given me.</p>
